### Real Estate Price Prediction Project

#### **Objective:**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts real estate prices in Bangalore. The model takes input features such as the square footage of the house, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location to predict the approximate selling price. The primary goal is to create an accurate prediction system that can assist in real estate decision-making.

#### **Tech Stacks and Libraries Learned:**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: 
  - **Pandas**: Used for data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering.
  - **Numpy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting and understanding trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - **Scikit-Learn (Sklearn)**: Used for model building and evaluation, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, K-fold cross-validation, and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Saving**: 
  - **Pickle/Joblib**: Used for saving and loading the trained machine learning model for future use.

#### **Result:**

- A linear regression-based machine learning model was successfully built to predict real estate prices in Bangalore.
- The model was evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**, showing reasonable accuracy in price predictions.
- The final model was deployed into a web application where users can input features (e.g., location, square footage, bedrooms) and receive a price estimate.


This project highlights practical applications of data science concepts like feature engineering, outlier detection, regression models, and model deployment in real-world scenarios like real estate price prediction.
